### About Me
Hey there! I’m Zabil — the kind of developer who can debug a 500 error without breaking (too much) of a sweat.
Currently juggling:
- Working remotely as a Full-Stack Developer in Makassar
- Building Laravel side projects for fun and trying new tools
- Running backend experiments with Express.js + whatever’s new
- Starting a software house startup while managing products that are already deployed

---

### My Favorite Tools
| Category | Stack |
|-----------|--------|
| **Backend** | Express.js |
| **Database** | MySQL, PostgreSQL |
| **Frontend** | Based on my mood at that time |
| **FullStack** | Laravel 12 |

### My Coding Philosophy

### Sodra Tech
I run **[Sodra Tech](https://instagram.com/sodra.tech)** —  
where we turn ideas and chaos into client-ready code.  
Expect programming memes, dev tips, and maybe a side of existential crisis.

### Fun Facts
- My debugging technique: **stare at the code until it stares back.**  
- I opened a WebSocket just to feel connected.
